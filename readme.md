# Lab | Feature engineering

- In this lab, you will use `learningSet.csv` file which you have already cloned in the previous activities. 
- Continue working in the same notebook as you did in the previous Lab. 

### Instructions

**Again go through all of the Numerical columns and apply the techniques that were performed in the lesson**

Then we will work on cleaning some of the other columns in the dataset using the techniques that we used before in the lessons.

- Check for null values in the numerical columns.
- After going through the lesson techniques there should only be a few columns left with NaN values to clean.
- Use appropriate methods to clean the columns which still contain NaN values.
- Use appropriate EDA technique where ever necessary.
